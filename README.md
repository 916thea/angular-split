#[WIP] angular-split

Allow you to split any views horizontally or vertically inside your Angular (**2+**) application using two simples components `<split>` and `<split-area>`


**Note:**

Previously, I coded an angular (**2+**) wrapper to Split.js library ([ng2-split](https://bertrandg.github.io/ng2-split)) but I decided to rewrite it purely in Angular for following reasons:

- No more dependency except Angular.
- AOT compilation compliant.
- Use latest Flexbox CSS grid system.
- Fun!
